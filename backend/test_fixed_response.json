  "answer": "I searched the database for games containing the position from the FEN:\nrnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1\n\nUnfortunately, I could not find any games in our database that contain this specific position. This could be because:\n\n1. This position might be from a less common line or opening variation\n2. The position might be from the middle or endgame phase that's not well-represented in our database\n3. The database might not contain enough games covering this particular position\n\nTo help you analyze this position, I can:\n- Provide engine analysis of the current position\n- Suggest similar opening lines if this is from the opening phase\n- Offer general strategic principles that apply to this type of position\n\nWould you like me to analyze the position from a strategic or tactical perspective instead?",
